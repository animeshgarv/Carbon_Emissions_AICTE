# 🌍 Carbon Emissions Prediction – Internship Project

Hey there! 👋  
This is my personal repository for tracking progress on an internship project where I'm working on **predicting carbon emissions** using historical climate data. The aim is to explore how environmental factors relate to CO₂ output and eventually build a predictive model based on those patterns.

---

## 📁 What’s Included (Week 1)

- `climate_change_download_0.xls` – The raw dataset containing various climate and emission-related indicators.
- `data_cleaned.csv` – Cleaned version of the dataset after handling missing values and formatting.
- `1_data_preparation.ipynb` – The notebook where I:
  - Loaded and explored the raw data
  - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset
  - Exported it to a cleaner format for further analysis

## 🔍 What I’m Exploring

Throughout this internship, I’ll be:
- Understanding how climate indicators affect carbon emissions
- Applying data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Using machine learning tools to build and evaluate predictive models
- Improving both technical and research-based understanding of environmental data

This repo will be updated regularly as I move forward in the project. Suggestions, feedback, or discussions are always welcome!
