# 🌍 Carbon Emissions Prediction – Internship Project

Welcome to my internship project repository!  
This project focuses on predicting **carbon emissions** using historical climate data. The goal is to explore how environmental indicators—like fossil fuel use, temperature changes, and other climate factors—correlate with CO₂ output, and to build a predictive model based on these relationships.

## 📁 Week 1 – Data Preparation

- `climate_change_download_0.xls`  
  Raw dataset containing climate-related and emission-related data from external sources.

- `data_cleaned.csv`  
  Cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for analysis, with missing values handled and formatting issues fixed.

- `1_data_preparation.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook where I:
  - Explored and loaded the raw data
  - Cleaned and structured the dataset
  - Exported it to a cleaner format for further analysis

## 📁 Week 2 – Data Exploration

- `2_data_exploration.ipynb`  
  This notebook was provided by the mentor and covers basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned dataset.

  This week, I:
  - Ran and reviewed all sections of the notebook
  - Gained insights into variable distributions and correlations
  - Took notes on potentially important features for prediction
  - Prepared for upcoming work on feature engineering and modeling

## 🔍 Project Overview

The broader goals of this project include:
- Analyzing key patterns and trends in carbon emissions over time
- Understanding the impact of climate indicators on emissions
- Applying data cleaning, feature selection, and visualization techniques
- Building and evaluating predictive models using machine learning

## 📌 Notes

- This repository is being updated weekly as the project progresses.
- All work is part of a guided internship where I follow mentor inputs while contributing independently.
- The project is a learning-focused journey, and feedback is always welcome!
