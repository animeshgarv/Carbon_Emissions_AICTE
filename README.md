# 🌍 Carbon Emissions Prediction – Internship Project

Welcome to my internship project repository!  
This project focuses on predicting **carbon emissions** using historical climate data. The goal is to explore how environmental indicators—like fossil fuel use, temperature changes, and other climate factors—correlate with CO₂ output, and to build a predictive model based on these relationships.

## 📁 Week 1 – Data Preparation

- `climate_change_download_0.xls`  
  Raw dataset containing climate-related and emission-related data from external sources.

- `data_cleaned.csv`  
  Cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for analysis, with missing values handled and formatting issues fixed.

- `1_data_preparation.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook where I:
  - Explored and loaded the raw data
  - Cleaned and structured the dataset
  - Exported it to a cleaner format for further analysis

---

## 📁 Week 2 – Data Exploration

- `2_data_exploration.ipynb`  
  Mentor-provided notebook used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned dataset.

  This week, I:
  - Ran and reviewed each section to understand trends and distributions
  - Observed variable correlations and potential feature relationships
  - Took notes for use in model design in the next stage

## 📁 Week 3 – Model Building

- `3_model_building.ipynb`  
  This notebook builds a predictive model for CO₂ emissions based on the cleaned dataset.

  This week, I:
  - Followed the complete modeling workflow
  - Ran the full pipeline including training and prediction
  - Reviewed model inputs, outputs, and performance

- Trained model file (`forecasting_co2_emmision.pkl`)  
  ⚠️ The `.pkl` file is too large to upload directly to GitHub.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The broader goals of this project include:
- Analyzing key patterns and trends in carbon emissions over time
- Understanding the impact of climate indicators on emissions
- Applying data cleaning, feature selection, and visualization techniques
- Building and evaluating predictive models using machine learning

## 📌 Notes

- This repository contains the final project work completed as part of the internship.
- The structure and base code were guided by the mentor. All notebooks were executed, reviewed, and understood thoroughly as part of the learning process.
